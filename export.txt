Export to CSV — Design Plan

The goal of this feature is to let users export the list of transactions they
currently see in the Expense Tracker into a CSV file. The exported file should
start with column headers and include one line per transaction.

In the interface, the user would get an extra text box or file chooser to enter
a filename (for example, expenses.csv) and a new “Export CSV” button. When the
button is clicked, the controller reads the filename, checks that it is valid,
and then collects the transactions currently shown in the table (which might be
filtered). The controller then calls a helper class named CsvExporter to write
those transactions to the file. If the export succeeds, the view shows a short
confirmation message; if it fails, the user sees a clear error message and can
try again.

The CsvExporter class would be responsible for writing the file. It would
include a simple export method that writes headers followed by one line per
transaction. The design follows the MVC structure and the open-closed principle,
since new export formats could be added later without changing the controller.

Common error cases include invalid filenames, permission problems, or an empty
transaction list. The program should check for these early and display helpful
messages. The design keeps the user interface simple, prevents errors
through validation, and keeps each part of the system focused on a single
responsibility.
